Today, June 4th 2018, the evil software corporation known as "Microsoft" has
announced an agreement to acquire GitHub. For this reason, I have decided to
stop using GitHub for my personal projects and move to some other web-based
version control hosting. I am currently considering Savannah, Bitbucket, GitLab
or a self-hosted solution. I will update this repository once I have taken a
decision and finished the migration.

Thank you GitHub for these past ten years serving the libre software community,
you will be missed!
