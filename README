Today, June 4th 2018, the evil software corporation known as "Microsoft" has
announced an agreement to acquire GitHub. For this reason, I have decided to
stop using GitHub for my personal projects and move to some other web-based
version control hosting.

After considering various different options, I have concluded that GitLab is
an excelent alternative to GitHub. You can find my new profile page here:

Thank you GitHub for these past ten years serving the libre software community,
you will be missed!
